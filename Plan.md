# Test Plan for RBTES-20: Multi-Factor Authentication

## 1. Overview
This test plan is for the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in the RBTest project. The objective is to enhance security by requiring an additional authentication factor during user login.

## 2. Objectives & Tasks
* Verify MFA setup for new and existing users.
* Validate login flow with and without MFA enabled.
* Confirm interoperability with other authentication mechanisms.
* Test various supported authentication factors (e.g., SMS, Email, Authenticator Apps).

## 3. Scope
**In Scope**
- User enrollment into MFA.
- Login requirements with MFA enabled.
- Backup and recovery scenarios (e.g., lost device).

**Out of Scope**
- Third-party integrations not using core authentication.

## 4. Test Strategy
- **Manual Testing:** For UI/UX and enrollment workflows.
- **Automation:** Regression scripts for login and factor validation.
- **Negative Testing:** Attempt authentication with wrong/expired tokens.

## 5. Test Scenarios
1. **MFA Enrollment**
   - New user enrollment.
   - Enabling MFA for existing users.
2. **Login Flow**
   - Standard login with MFA enabled.
   - Login with MFA disabled (baseline).
   - Invalid code entry (expired, wrong, reused code).
3. **Recovery**
   - Lost device: Test backup options or SMS fallback.
   - Reset MFA via admin/user support.
4. **Security**
   - Rate limiting for failed MFA attempts.
   - Replay attack and token reuse prevention.

## 6. Exit Criteria
- All critical and major severity bugs are resolved.
- MFA works for all defined user scenarios.
- Regression passes for core authentication flows.

## 7. Risks & Assumptions
- Users have access to the second factor device or channel.
- Possible delays if integration with external providers is unstable.
